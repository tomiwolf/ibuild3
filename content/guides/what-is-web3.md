Web3 is about the next evolution of the web. A web that is more open, transparent and permissionless and runs on decentralized infrastructure such as blockchains. Global and decentralized applications (DApps) that anyone can interact with. They often have native assets integrated (such as Ether) to transact value, but are not just about money or payments. These decentralized applications offer a range of digitial services, such as storage, bandwidth and computation without any risk of downtime, censorship, fraud, or 3rd-party interference.

## Benefits

- **Open** - in that they are built from open-source software, by an open and accessible community of developers and executed in full view of the world. 
- **Trustless** - in that the network itself allows participants to interact publicly, or privately without a trusted third party
- **Permissionless** - in that anyone, both users and suppliers, can participate without authorisation from a governing body


## Opportunities

- Financial Tools (payments, fund raising, lending, borrowing,..)
- Identity solutions (self-sovereign, decentralized identifiers,..) 
- More secure voting and governance mechanisms
- Efficient resources management (CO2 tracking, smart grid’s,..)
- Digital ownership registries (e.g. land, collectibles, NFT’s,..)
- Supply chain tracking
