Many of our teams merge fully into client projects for a period of time. At any one time, we’ll have around 60 or 70 builders engaged in client or internal projects. As a DAO, all of our builders (we call our members ‘builders’) are DAO members and have to meet our Criteria for Remaining Active on a quarterly basis. We are constantly trying to balance the needs of a DAO (an active and engaged community) with how busy many of our builders are (with not a huge amount of available time or energy), and are often exploring how we can improve our systems and processes to achieve this balance. This means that we are often in flux, which is both exciting and challenging.</p>\n",

Self-organising teams amalgamate to offer clients such as Badger, Gnosis Safe, and DoinGud a variety of services, from short-term development to longer-term product build. Many of our teams merge fully into client projects for a period of time. At any one time, we’ll have around 60 or 70 builders engaged in client or internal projects. As a DAO, all of our builders (we call our members ‘builders’) are DAO members and have to meet our Criteria for Remaining Active on a quarterly basis. We are constantly trying to balance the needs of a DAO (an active and engaged community) with how busy many of our builders are (with not a huge amount of available time or energy), and are often exploring how we can improve our systems and processes to achieve this balance. This means that we are often in flux, which is both exciting and challenging.</p>\n",
